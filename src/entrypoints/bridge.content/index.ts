// background would mean the `tabs` permission, and a Chrome listing that
// declares it reads your browsing history. Same information, none of the
// disclosure.

// Only host and port are ever read. The path, query and fragment are not
// touched, because the agent only needs to know whether this is a local dev
// server and a URL's query string routinely carries session tokens.
