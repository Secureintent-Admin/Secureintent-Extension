// Talking to the desktop agent over loopback.
//
// Connect-per-burst, never held open. Under MV3 the background service worker is
// killed after ~30s idle, so a socket opened once and kept would die with it —
// quietly, usually within a minute of the browser going quiet. Keeping it alive
// would mean a keepalive under 30s forever, which pins the worker resident on
// every machine running the agent. The desktop keeps no per-connection state
// beyond "did the hello happen", so a socket per report is the cheaper side of
// that trade for both of us.
//
// Pairing is a token the person copies out of the desktop app's dashboard, which
// shows both the endpoint and the token. There is no HTTP handout to fetch it
// from: the desktop's local API has only `/health` and `/scan`, `/scan` already
// requires the token, and neither sends CORS headers — so a fetch from here would
// be discarded by the browser even if an endpoint existed. WebSockets have no
// CORS, which is why this path needs no host permission at all.
//
// Everything here fails silently. The bridge stops the two products warning about
// one copy twice; nothing about the paste guard may depend on the agent being
// installed, running, or reachable.
