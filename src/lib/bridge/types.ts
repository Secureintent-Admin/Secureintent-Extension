 * single `url` field, and a frame without it fails to parse and is dropped in
 * silence. So it is required, and it carries the **origin only**: scheme, host
 * and port, never a path, query or fragment. A dev URL's query string routinely
 * holds session tokens and none of that is needed to recognise localhost.
 *
 * `host`, `port` and `ts` are the shape the desktop side asked for in review.
 * Their serde ignores unknown fields, so sending both means the switch to the
 * narrower form is theirs to make whenever they like, with no flag day.
