# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

The browser-extension half of **SecureIntent.AI** — a DLP (data-loss-prevention) tool that warns
developers *before* they paste secrets into untrusted destinations. See [PROJECT.MD](PROJECT.MD) for
the full Statement of Work, scope, and timeline.

The end-to-end design:

- Content scripts capture **paste events** and render warnings in a **closed Shadow DOM overlay**
  (closed so host pages can't inspect or tamper with it).
- A **client-side pre-filter** does cheap detection on-device using a signed pattern bundle fetched
  from the Worker. The `killSwitch` field in the bundle can disable the guard remotely.
- Telemetry posts to the Worker, which inserts straight into **ClickHouse** (`ctx.waitUntil`; no Queue
  yet). Pattern bundles are Ed25519-signed and refreshed every 2 hours via a background alarm (and on
  popup demand).
- **Raw pasted text never leaves the device** — only a salted SHA-256 fingerprint is sent. Treat this
  privacy boundary as a hard constraint in any code that touches paste content.
- Cross-browser from one codebase: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera. Chrome ships MV3, Firefox MV2.

### Sibling repos (each its own git remote, all part of one product)

- `../backend` — Cloudflare Worker (Hono) at `api.secureintent.ai`: signed config bundle
  (`/v1/config`), telemetry (`/v1/telemetry`), signed entitlement (`/v1/entitlement`), quota
  (`/v1/usage`), Clerk/Paddle/promo. Has its own `CLAUDE.md`.
- `../landing_page` — the static `secureintent.ai` site (marketing + `account.html`, the Clerk sign-in
  / Paddle checkout page the extension links to). Has its own `CLAUDE.md`.

Anything touching auth, entitlement, quota, or telemetry shape is a **two-repo change** — the Worker
contract in `../backend/src/routes/` must move with it.

## Stack

[WXT](https://wxt.dev) (extension framework, wraps Vite) + React 19 + TypeScript. WXT handles the
manifest, MV3 entrypoint wiring, cross-browser builds, and HMR — there is no hand-written
`manifest.json`. **Biome** is the linter/formatter (not ESLint/Prettier). **Semgrep** runs custom
rules in `semgrep/`. **Playwright** drives the live end-to-end suite in `e2e/`.

## Commands

**Use `pnpm` for everything** (the project is pinned to pnpm; do not use npm/yarn).

```bash
pnpm dev            # dev server, Chrome target, HMR
pnpm dev:firefox    # dev server, Firefox target
pnpm build          # production build → dist/chrome-mv3/ (outDir is dist, not .output)
pnpm build:firefox  # → dist/firefox-mv2/
pnpm zip            # packaged zip for store submission (Chrome)
pnpm zip:firefox    # AMO zip (also emits a -sources.zip)
pnpm compile        # tsc --noEmit — type-check
pnpm lint           # biome lint
pnpm check          # biome check (lint + format); check:fix to auto-fix
pnpm format         # biome format --write
pnpm semgrep        # run custom Semgrep rules (semgrep/), fail on findings
                    #   needs `brew install semgrep` — it is a Python tool, not a dependency
                    #   here, so a clean checkout has the script but not the binary. Same for
                    #   Playwright's browsers: `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`.
pnpm test           # vitest run (unit tests, colocated *.test.ts)
pnpm test:watch     # vitest watch
pnpm coverage       # vitest run --coverage
```

Run a single test file: `pnpm test <name>` (e.g. `pnpm test detection`) — vitest filters by path
substring.

Unit tests use Vitest with the `WxtVitest` plugin (`vitest.config.ts`), jsdom, and
`wxt/testing/fake-browser` for `browser.*`/storage. Test files live next to the code as
`*.test.ts(x)`. SOW target is ≥85% coverage on pure logic (`src/lib/`, `src/content/`,
`src/services/`); thin `createShadowRootUi` mount wrappers in `src/overlay/mount*.ts` are excluded and
verified via build + manual load.

**E2E** (Playwright, builds the extension then loads it in a real Chromium):

```bash
pnpm e2e               # canary + fallback specs (no live network)
pnpm e2e:live          # live LLM sites (needs e2e:login session first)
pnpm e2e:roundtrip     # anonymize → rehydrate vault roundtrip
pnpm e2e:ghost         # large-log sanitization
pnpm e2e:session-lock  # cloud-console PIN lock
pnpm e2e:consent       # first-run Terms & Privacy gate
pnpm e2e:install       # creator attribution on install (stub API on :8788, never prod)
pnpm e2e:login         # one-time: capture a logged-in browser session
```

`e2e:install` seeds the creator cookie into a profile, *then* loads the extension into
it, so `onInstalled` fires with the cookie already present — the real ordering (click
precedes install). Cookies seeded via `addCookies` need an explicit `expires`, or the
profile drops them as session cookies on close.

**Build-time env** (`.env`, WXT `WXT_`-prefixed, see `src/lib/clerkConfig.ts`):
`WXT_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (auth is disabled entirely when empty), `WXT_CLERK_SYNC_HOST`
(default `https://clerk.secureintent.ai`), `WXT_WEB_APP_URL` (default `https://secureintent.ai`).

## Code layout

All source lives under `src/` (WXT `srcDir: 'src'`). Per-site content scripts are **thin** — each just
passes `{ name, siteKey }` to `createPasteGuard`. All real logic lives in pure, testable modules under
`src/content/`, `src/lib/`, and `src/services/`.

**Adding a new site** requires a new `src/entrypoints/<site>.content/index.ts` that passes
`{ name, siteKey }` to `createPasteGuard`, a `matches` host list, and a selector entry in
`src/content/siteSelectors.ts` (plus a manifest change → store resubmit). Changing an existing site's
selector or patterns is done via a remote bundle update (no resubmit). Even with no dedicated
entrypoint a site is still covered by the **fallback** catch-all guard; dedicated entrypoints exist for
beating the page's own handlers and site-specific selectors. Keep the popup's supported-host list in
sync.

```

## Key invariants

- **Raw pasted text never leaves the device** — only the salted SHA-256 fingerprint is computed and
  sent in telemetry. Never log or transmit paste text. The same boundary applies to the vault (token →
  secret pairs live only in `storage.session`, never on disk, never to network).
- The overlay uses a **closed** shadow root; both guards **fail open** (any error lets the paste/page
  through rather than trapping the user).
- The paste handler must call `preventDefault`/`stopImmediatePropagation` **synchronously**, before
  any `await`. The `enabled` flag and the vault snapshot are cached in local vars (refreshed via
  watchers) and read synchronously — don't turn those into `await`s inside the handler.
- Content scripts register at `runAt: 'document_start'` with a **capture-phase** listener so they beat
  the page's own paste handlers. Programmatic pastes (our own `execCommand('insertText')` re-inserts)
  are skipped via `e.isTrusted`.
- Detection is regex-then-validator; overlapping matches resolve by `TYPE_RANK` (private-key >
  known-key > env-credential), then longer match wins. Broad regexes (cards) are confirmed by a
  post-match validator (Luhn / entropy) to avoid false positives.
- The guard reads the active bundle at content-script boot, then resolves the input selector as
  `bundle.sites[siteKey]?.inputSelector ?? siteSelectors[siteKey]` (remote overrides static fallback).
- Remote config is **Ed25519-signed** and verified before use; the embedded public key must match the
  Worker's signing key. Bundles are accepted only if strictly newer (`version >` current).

## Overlay actions (paste-guard)

The warning dialog offers three outcomes, mapped to telemetry actions in `createPasteGuard`:

- **paste** → `paste_anyway` — insert the original text (for a large log, `sanitize()` scrubs it first).
- **redact** → `paste_anonymously` — `tokenizeSecrets` replaces each secret with a `⟦SI:…⟧` token,
  inserts the masked text, and stores the `token → secret` entries in the **vault** so the destination
  can be rehydrated later in the same session.
- **cancel** → `cancelled` — drop the paste entirely.

## Session lock

A separate, opt-in feature (`sessionlock.content` + `createSessionLock` + `lib/lock`). After
inactivity or tab-away it covers high-risk cloud consoles with a PIN gate. The PIN is hashed with the
same per-install salt + SHA-256 as the fingerprint module (never stored plaintext). A per-tab
`sessionStorage` flag survives a reload (a refresh can't bypass the lock) and clears on tab close.
Fails open on error.

## Free & paid tiers (single build)

There is **no open-core split**. One build ships both the free and the paid features; the extension is
a single product with free and paid tiers, not a public core plus a private pro repo. The repo is
still **source-available (view-only — see [LICENSE](LICENSE))**.

- Paid features (`rehydrate`, `ghost`, `session_lock`) ship in this build but are **gated at runtime**
  by a signed entitlement fetched from the Worker for the signed-in Clerk user — see `src/lib/entitlement/`
  and the Clerk/Paddle wiring in `src/services/entitlementBackground.ts`. The entitlement blob is
  Ed25519-signed (same verify path as the config bundle) and evaluated locally; it **fails safe to
  free** on any invalid/expired/missing state.
- Client-side gating is a UX gate, **not** the security boundary: the source is viewable and the checks
  are patchable. The valuable logic and license truth live server-side in `backend/` — treat the client
  gate as convenience, not enforcement.
- `src/lib/features/` — internal feature-hook registry (`registerFeature` + `notifyDetections`/
  `notifyAction`). Hooks get detection **metadata only** (counts/types/labels); raw clipboard text is
  never passed, same hard privacy boundary as everywhere.
- `src/core.ts` — internal API barrel that groups the reusable guard/overlay/detection exports. Retained
  as a convenience seam; it is **no longer an external publish target** (no `@secureintent/core` package,
  no `BUILD_TARGET=pro` build).

### Auth (Clerk) — two different paths per browser

There is no in-extension sign-in form; users sign in on the web app (`ACCOUNT_URL` →
`secureintent.ai/account.html`) and the extension mirrors that session.

- **Chrome/Edge/Opera (MV3):** `@clerk/chrome-extension` with `syncHost = https://clerk.secureintent.ai`
  mints a **templated** session token (JWT template `secureintent`, carries `email` +
  `public_metadata`). The manifest pins `key` so the `chrome-extension://` origin stays stable for
  Clerk's allowed origins and the Worker's `CLERK_AUTHORIZED_PARTIES`.
- **Firefox (MV2):** the SDK can't mint a token (its FAPI call comes from a random
  `moz-extension://` origin Clerk can't allowlist), so `services/cookieToken.ts` reads the Clerk
  `__session` cookie via `browser.cookies`. That default token has only `sub` — the Worker's
  `hydrateClaims` fills email/metadata from the Clerk backend API. Requires the `cookies` permission
  plus host permissions for both domains.
- The entitlement blob is bound to a Clerk user id: `evaluateBlob` rejects a blob whose `clerkUserId`
  doesn't match the live session, so a signed Pro blob can't be copied into another install. The
  background clears a mismatched cache; content scripts skip the check and rely on that.

### Anonymise & Paste quota (free tier)

Free users get `OFFLINE_LIMIT` (10) anonymised pastes per UTC month. When the allowance is spent the
overlay and the popup say so and name the reset date (`lib/quota/reset.ts`) rather than showing the
same "· Pro" badge as a user who never had the feature. Signed out, the count lives
on-device in `lib/quota/offline.ts` — deliberately obfuscated (XOR-folded token under an innocuous
storage key) so it doesn't read as a plain counter; a UX gate, not a security boundary. Signed in, it
routes to the Worker's `/v1/usage`, which reconciles the offline count forward with a MAX-only seed
(`X-SI-Offline-Used`), so signing in never grants a fresh allowance. Pro is unlimited. Backend
unreachable → fall back to the on-device count.

### Counting installs and uninstalls

`services/installAttribution.ts` reports **every** install to `POST /v1/install` — with the creator
slug when a link put one in our cookie, without it otherwise. Organic installs are the denominator;
dropping them leaves no way to tell a quiet week from a broken report. The payload is a random
install id, the build (browser + version) and the coarse platform from `getPlatformInfo()` — never
the arch, never anything about the person.

Uninstalls come from `runtime.setUninstallURL`. Nothing of ours runs at removal, so the address is
registered while the extension is alive — on install, at every startup, and again once the server's
token arrives — and the browser opens it on the way out. `syncUninstallUrl()` is the only thing that
sets it, and it *clears* it on Firefox until the Terms are accepted: that build promises AMO
`data_collection_permissions: { required: ['none'] }`, and an armed ping is a report.

### Consent gate

`lib/consent` stores a `{ version, acceptedAt }` record in **sync** storage. Until the current
`TERMS_VERSION` is accepted, the paste guard shows a consent gate on the first warning and the popup
shows a consent screen; the `welcome/` page is the normal first-run accept path. Bump `TERMS_VERSION`
to re-prompt everyone after a terms change. The gate is dismissable the same three ways as the
warning dialog (Escape / × / scrim) and says what that costs: the paste it interrupted is dropped.

### One upgrade destination

Every upgrade CTA — the popup's Upgrade button and the overlay's locked Pro action (which posts
`si-open-upgrade` to the background) — opens `ACCOUNT_URL`. The marketing `#tiers` section is for
people who don't have the extension yet, so it's never an in-product CTA target.

### Desktop bridge (opt-in)

The SecureIntent **desktop app** also watches the clipboard, so without coordination both
products warn about the same copy. The bridge is how they avoid that. It is **off by default**
and needs a pairing token, so an unpaired browser never opens a local port.

- `bridge.content` (all pages, `document_idle`) reports the **focused tab's host and port** to
  the background, debounced 250ms and only when they actually change — a content script reads its
  own address with no permission, whereas watching tabs from the background would need `tabs` and a
  listing that declares it reads browsing history.
- The background sends two messages over `ws://127.0.0.1:<port>`:
  `browser_url` (so the agent can recognise a local dev server) and `handled` (so it doesn't raise
  its own alert for a copy we already warned about).
- **Connect-per-burst, never held open.** An MV3 worker is killed after ~30s idle, so a held socket
  dies with it; keeping it alive would mean a keepalive forever and a permanently resident worker.
- **Pairing is a token pasted into the popup**, copied from the desktop app's dashboard. There is no
  HTTP handout: the agent's local API is `/health` + `/scan` only, `/scan` already requires the
  token, and it sends no CORS headers — so a `fetch` would be discarded. WebSockets have no CORS,
  which is why this needs **no host permission**.
- Discovery is authentication: the first port in **8137–8141** that answers the handshake with
  `welcome: true`. A squatter can't fake that without the token.

Two things that will bite anyone changing this:

- **`browser_url` must carry `url`.** The agent's `BrowserUrl` variant has a single `url` field and
  drops a frame it can't deserialise *in silence*. `url` is the **origin only** — a path or query
  would leak session tokens. `host`/`port`/`ts` ride along because the agent ignores unknown fields.
- **The `handled` hash is a u64 and must not pass through a JS number.** It exceeds
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, so `JSON.stringify` corrupts it (…433931 → …434000) and every dedup
  misses silently. `lib/bridge/hash.ts` builds that frame by hand; there is a test asserting it.

### Firefox / MV2 gotchas

`browser.action` doesn't exist under MV2 — always go through `lib/browserAction.ts`. `wxt.config.ts`
branches on `browser === 'firefox'` for `browser_specific_settings` (stable add-on id, `strict_min_version`
115 for `storage.session`, and AMO's required `data_collection_permissions`) and drops the Chrome-only
`key`. Gate any Chrome-only path on `IS_FIREFOX` from `lib/clerkConfig.ts`.

## WXT conventions

- **Entrypoints are discovered by filename** in `src/entrypoints/`: `{name}.{ext}` or
  `{name}/index.{ext}` only — deeply nested files (e.g. `content/chatgpt.ts`) are NOT entrypoints. A
  file is a *content script* when its name is `content` or ends in `.content` (so the folder is
  `<site>.content/`). Note `src/content/` is a plain logic dir, **not** an entrypoint folder.
- `@/` resolves to `src/` (the srcDir), e.g. `@/lib/...`, `@/content/...`, `@/assets/...`.
- Import WXT APIs from the **`#imports`** virtual module
  (`import { defineContentScript, createShadowRootUi, ContentScriptContext, storage } from '#imports'`).
  These also work as auto-imported globals, but `#imports` is explicit and used throughout this repo.
- `defineBackground` and `browser` are likewise available via `#imports` / auto-import.
- Files under `public/` are served from the web-accessible root, referenced with a leading slash.
- WXT config is `wxt.config.ts`; the React integration is enabled via the `@wxt-dev/module-react`
  module there. `tsconfig.json` extends the generated `.wxt/tsconfig.json` — don't edit the generated
  one.
- The `postinstall` script runs `wxt prepare`, which regenerates `.wxt/`. If types or auto-imports go
  missing, run `wxt prepare`.
